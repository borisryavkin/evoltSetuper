# EVOLT Key Emulation (Arduino)

Arduino-based key emulation to automate the EVOLT machine setup process.

## Repository structure

This repo contains multiple folders that represent different interaction scenarios.
The work started as step-by-step development, so each folder reflects a stage or
variant of the approach. Ideally, these stages would be separate commits, but
they are preserved here as distinct folders instead.

If you are looking for a specific scenario, check each folder for its sketch and
notes to find the variant that matches your setup.
